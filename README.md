# X-COVNets
This repository aims to provide a library of open-source models for computer-aided diagnosis of pneumonia-like lung diseases. Using deep transfer learning through the Xception architecture, Deep Convolutional Neural Network Models have been trained on the COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Database to classify COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy patients.
